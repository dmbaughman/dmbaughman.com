One of our back-end developers created a REST-ful API, and I worked with a fellow front-end developer to create a lightweight AJAX-powered front-end.  We used Backbone.js for the client-side MVC framework, Handlebars.js as the templating language, and Bootstrap as the front-end framework."

This was my first responsive design project, and I created a high-fidelity prototype using HTML and CSS3.  That design was then implemented into SharePoint by creating a custom master page and modified XSLT, along with a few design enhancements.  Needless to say, I developed a healthy distaste for SharePoint design."
