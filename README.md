==============
This is the complete source code for my website, dmbaughman.com.  Feel free to learn whatever you want from what I've done.

Stuff I used:
* Bootstrap - UI framework/pattern library
* Wok - Python-based static HTML generator, which also uses Jinja, YAML, and Markdown
* Handlebars.js - JavaScript template library (or whatever you call it)--use this to make yer JSON into purdy HTML.
* My brains
